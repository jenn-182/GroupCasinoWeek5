Craps is a dice game that revolves around the rolls of two dice. 
Players take turns rolling the dice, and this player is called the "shooter." 
A round of craps is divided into two phases: the "come-out roll" and the "point phase."

COME OUT ROLL:
===================================================================================================================
-The shooter's first roll of a round is the come-out roll.
-If the shooter rolls a 7 or 11, it's a "natural" and is an immediate win for pass line bets. The shooter rolls again.
-If the shooter rolls a 2, 3, or 12, it's "craps" and is an immediate loss for pass line bets. The shooter rolls again.
-If the shooter rolls a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, that number becomes the "point." The round moves to the point phase. The dealer places a white puck that says "ON" on the corresponding number on the table.

Point phase:
===================================================================================================================
-The shooter continues to roll the dice.
-To win, the shooter must roll the point number again before rolling a 7.
-If the shooter rolls the point number, pass line bets win. The round ends and a new come-out roll begins.\
-If the shooter rolls a 7, it's a "seven-out" and pass line bets lose. The round ends, and the dice are passed to the next shooter.

Basic Bets:
===================================================================================================================
-Pass Line: You are betting the shooter will win. You win on a come-out roll of 7 or 11, or if the shooter makes the point before rolling a 7. You lose on a come-out roll of 2, 3, or 12, or if the shooter rolls a 7 before making the point.

-Don't Pass Line: This is the opposite of the pass line bet. You are betting the shooter will lose. You win on a come-out roll of 2 or 3, lose on a 7 or 11, and a 12 is a tie (push). If a point is established, you win if a 7 is rolled before the point, and lose if the point is made.

-Come Bet: This bet can only be made after a point has been established. It works just like a pass line bet but for a new "come-out roll" within the current point phase. You win if the next roll is a 7 or 11, and lose on a 2, 3, or 12. If another number is rolled, it becomes your "come point." You win if that come point is rolled again before a 7 is rolled.

-Don't Come Bet: This is the opposite of a come bet. You win on a 2 or 3, lose on a 7 or 11, and a 12 is a tie. If a point is established, you win if a 7 is rolled before the point.

Other common bets:
===================================================================================================================
-Place Bets: You can bet on any of the point numbers (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10). You win if your number is rolled before a 7, and lose if a 7 is rolled first.

-Field Bets: This is a one-roll bet. You win if the next roll is a 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, or 12. The payout for a 2 or 12 is often higher than the others.

-Hardways: This is a bet that a number (4, 6, 8, or 10) will be rolled with matching dice (e.g., "hard 8" is two 4s) before a 7 is rolled or the number is rolled the "easy way" (e.g., an 8 with a 6 and 2).
