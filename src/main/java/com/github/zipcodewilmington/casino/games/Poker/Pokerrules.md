The Objective: The goal is to win the pot, which is the sum of all bets made by players in a hand. 

You can win the pot in two ways:
===================================================================================================================

1. By having the highest-ranking hand at the "showdown" (when all remaining players reveal their cards).
2. By making other players fold their hands, meaning they all give up their chance to win the pot.

The Hand:
===================================================================================================================
-The game is played with a standard 52-card deck. 
-A poker hand consists of five cards. 

The hands are ranked from highest to lowest:
===================================================================================================================

1. Royal Flush: A-K-Q-J-10, all of the same suit.
2. Straight Flush: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9-8-7-6-5 of clubs).
3. Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., four 7s).
4. Full House: Three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank (e.g., three 8s and two 4s).
5. Flush: Five cards of the same suit, but not in consecutive rank.
6. Straight: Five consecutive cards of different suits (e.g., 5-6-7-8-9 of mixed suits).
7. Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank.
8. Two Pair: Two cards of one rank and two cards of another rank.
9. One Pair: Two cards of the same rank.
10. High Card: If no other hand is made, the hand is ranked by its highest card.

The Game Flow :
===================================================================================================================

1. The Blinds: Before the cards are dealt, two players to the left of the dealer button post forced bets called the "small blind" and the "big blind." These ensure there's money to play for in every hand. The dealer button rotates clockwise after each hand.

2. The Deal (Pre-flop): Each player is dealt two private cards, called "hole cards."

3. First Betting Round (Pre-flop): The betting begins with the player to the left of the big blind. 

Players can choose to:
    -Fold: Throw away their cards and forfeit any money they've already put into the pot.
    -Call: Match the current bet.
    -Raise: Increase the current bet. The betting round continues clockwise until all active players have called or folded.

4. The Flop: Three community cards are dealt face-up in the center of the table. These are shared cards that all players can use to make their best five-card hand.

5. Second Betting Round: A new betting round begins with the first active player to the left of the dealer button.

6. The Turn: A fourth community card is dealt face-up.

7. Third Betting Round: Another round of betting ensues.

8. The River: The fifth and final community card is dealt face-up.

9. Final Betting Round: The last round of betting takes place.

10. The Showdown: If more than one player remains, the active players reveal their cards. The player with the best five-card hand, using any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards, wins the pot.

Betting Actions:
===================================================================================================================

1.Check: If no one has bet yet in a round, a player can "check," which means they pass the action to the next player without betting.
2.All-in: A player can bet all of their remaining chips at any time.
